this is built on buildable as floors Original mod by FrozenSnowFox. V1.1 
you can now build any terrain tile over any other terrain tile work amounts have been changed to give it abit of balance

important note if you switch from the other version of this mod to this one and try to load a saved game it can crash the game and it will at least mess up any built tiles 


future plans
add lava (all lairs under mountains should have lava) 
at some point i think it should be needed to mine soil/sand/water to add abit more to terroforming 
also plan to make each terrain need different amounts of work based on what its built over </description>
